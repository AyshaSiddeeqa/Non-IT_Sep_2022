
Access specifier
================

Public : any one can access it
Private: Restricted to use in other classes
Protected- Accessed within the package/diff package and with subclasses
Default - Accessed within the same package and with subclasses and requires no keyword

Operators:
==========
  Arithmetic Operators
           +,-,/,*,=
		   %->mod-->remainders
		   6%3=0   		   
  
  Logical Operators
       && |  
  
  Conditional operators
  > < != == >=  <= 
  ++->incremental-->adding 1 to  anynumber
   i++     ->i=i+1-->post increment
   i+1
   ++i -->pre-increment
i--	--> decremental
i-1
--i

Control Statements
==================
Conditional Statement -decision 
Looping Statement- iterative
Jump Statement- stop/continue

Conditional statement
=====================
if -->condition is satisfied 
 else->not satisfied
 
Looping Statement- iterative
===========================
for--> (input;condtion;condtion)


 Non-Primitive
 =============
Arrays-->holds collection/set of data which belongs to same datatype

name =vidya,yatheesh,priya,balaji,hema
rollno=1,2,3,4,5
phno=1233434595,345435436,13424535
height=122,125,127


  -->can increase or decrese the size
  -->fixed in size/size cannot be changed

datatype[] variable ={1,2,3,4,5};
int[] num= new int[5];

To Sort the Array
Arrays.sort(arr);

To find the length 
arr.length;

To print an array 
use forloop
To print directly->Arrays.toString(arr);

   

classroom:1
Print if the given number is odd or even
Goal: To understand the mod operator, conditional statement and logic writing
a) Create a class by name: OddOrEven
b) Create a main method using shortcut
c) Declare a class variable of type of int with a value as input
d) Write a logic to print if the given input is odd or even
Hint: Divide the given input by 2 and if the remainder is 0 -> even else odd. 
Use mod (%) operator to find remainder
================

Classroom:2
Find Factorial of a given number
Goal: To understand the for loop and logic writing
a) Create a class by name: Factorial
b) Create a main method using shortcut
c) Declare a class variable of type of int with a value as input
d) Write a logic to print the factorial of the given input
Hint: use for loop from 1 --> n and multiply with previous multiplied value

Classroom:3
===========
Find the max and min values of the int array
int[] nums = {22, 3981, -19, 82, 0, 45, 37};
max -> 3981
min -> -19
Goal: To understand the Arrays, sort
a) Create a class by name: FindMinMax (with main method) in same package
b) Create a int[] array with different data not in sorted order
c) Write a logic to sort and find the min, max
d) Run and Confirm the correct values are printed in console
Hint: Use sort and find the min and max by indices

Classroom:4
===========
Find the duplicate values in the given array
Goal: To understand the Arrays, loop, if
a) Create a class by name: FindDups (with main method) in same package
b) Create a int[] array with duplicate data
c) Write a logic to find the duplicate values
d) Run and Confirm the duplicate values are printed in console
Hint: Use sort to get the values sorted and within the loop, compare the next values.
If same, then print as duplicate else continue to next value.
